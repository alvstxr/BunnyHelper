# BunnyHelper – A Terminal To-Do App by The Bun AL (@alvstxr)

> **Antivirus Warning:**  
Some antivirus programs may flag this app as a trojan. This is **false positive detection** caused by:
- Accessing kernel-level features (e.g., system notifications)
- Lack of an official Microsoft app license (which costs up to €300/year)

To assure transparency, I'm sharing the **source code together with the app**.

---

## Usage

1. Run `BunnyHelper.exe`
2. Choose or create a profile
3. Use the menu options to:
   - Add/manage tasks, reminders, notes, and deadlines
   - Customize colors and more

> Keep the app open to receive notifications/reminders!

## Sharing

- To **share a profile**, just send the `profile_<name>.json` file
- Each user has their own `data/` folder for saved profiles
- You can now **export tasks as `.txt` files**
- Share the entire app by sending the `BunnyHelper.rar` archive
